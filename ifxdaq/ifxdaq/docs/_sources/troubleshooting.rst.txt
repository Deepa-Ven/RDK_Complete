FAQ / Troubleshooting
=====================

In this section we try to cover frequent problems. If you had an issue and found already a solution on your own, please
add it here.


**Why is the** ``ifxdaq`` **command not found if I call it from commandline?**

- Most probably the Python environment is not added to your PATH variable correctly.
- Check if ``ifxdaq`` is correctly installed with ``python -m pip list``. There should be some entry for ``ifxdaq``. If
  there is no entry, ``ifxdaq`` is not properly installed. Please have a look into the installation instructions.
- Try to run the commands explicitly with ``python -m ifxdaq``.

**Why is my Infineon Avian (BGT60TRxx) radar device not detected?**

- Make sure your radar board has the latest firmware (``>= 2.6.0``).
- If the board is connected, a green LED should blink in idle mode.
- Check with the ``Radar Fusion GUI`` (from Infineon Toolbox) or ``Sensing GUI`` if your device is visible.
- The radar boards have a low power consumption, but with long USB cables there could be some powered USB hub required.
- USB supports at maximum 5 meters without additional power supply, or 25 meters with serially chained USB hubs.

.. note::
    On UNIX: If your radar device is connected and ready (blinking LED), but not found by
    ``ifxdaq``, make sure that you can access the device file ``/dev/ttyAMCx`` (``x`` is a
    number specific to you computer). Additionally, make sure that your current user is in the
    group ``dialout``. You can check the groups of your current user using::

        $ groups

    To add your user to the group dialout, run::

        $ sudo usermod -a -G dialout username

    and replace ``username`` by your actual user name. Afterwards a restart might be required.

**Where do I get the latest firmware for my Infineon radar?**

- The firmware is part of the Radar Development Kit.

  - Direct download - *Infineon internal only*: `FW archive
    <https://sec-ishare.infineon.com/sites/Radar_SW_Releases/Shared%20Documents/Hatvan_FW>`_
  - via Installer:

    - Download & install the `Radar Development Kit
      <https://softwaretools.infineon.com/tools/com.ifx.tb.tool.ifxradarsdk>`_.
    - Download the Software package (Packages/Software) from the Radar Development Kit application.

- Extract the downloaded archive & follow the instructions in ``Firmware/Readme.pdf`` to flash your board.

**Why is my Intel RealSense not detected?**

- The Intel RealSense has a high power consumption. It might not work, if it is connected with long USB cables and/or
  unpowered USB hubs.
- Check with the `Intel RealSense Viewer <https://www.intelrealsense.com/sdk-2/>`_ if the device is visible. If it is
  not found here, ``ifxdaq`` will also not find it.
- Make sure to connect your Intel RealSense to a high speed USB port (USB 3.0 or higher; currently 3.2 works best).
- Update the firmware to version 05.13.00.50. This can be done with the `Intel RealSense Viewer
  <https://www.intelrealsense.com/sdk-2/>`_
- Use a USB hub with additional power supply.
- USB supports at maximum 5 meters without additional power supply, or 25 meters with serially chained USB hubs.

**Why is the connection to my devices instable (e.g. frame drops or reconnects)?**

- Probably, your USB port delivers not enough power to your devices.
- Use a USB hub with additional power supply.

**RaspberryPI - Why do I get a** ``libavfilter.so.7`` **error?**

- Raised exception:

  ``libavfilter.so.7: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory``

- We use ``PyAv`` that is based on ``ffmpeg`` to store ``.mp4`` files.
- Make sure ``ffmpeg`` is installed: ``sudo apt install ffmpeg``

----

**RaspberryPI - Why is my video recording lagging?**

- We use the ``H.264`` codec to compress videos on the fly into ``.mp4`` files.
- Software-based video encoding is a compute intensive task. Basically, this can be solved in two ways: - Powerful CPUs,
  which are in your laptops, but not on the RaspberryPi. - Highly optimized encoders, which are quite complicated to
  setup (-> `Tutorial on building encoders <https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=199775>`_).
- Solution: Use a low frame-rate **and** (/ or) low resolution on your RaspberryPi, e.g. VGA @ 15fps.

----

**Why do I get** ``OSError: [Errno 28] No space left on device`` **on the HPC (Gpu-Farm), when I try to label my
recordings?**

- On the HPC, every user's home directory (``~`` / ``/ifxhome/username``) has a 1GB limitation.
- By default, we cache our model weights inside ``~/.cache/ifxdaq``. If you download a model and exceed the 1GB
  limitation, the exception will be raised.
- Solution: Specify an alternative location for the ``ifxdaq`` cache directory: - ``setenv IFXDAQ_CACHE
  /your/desired/location`` - for the current shell and all subshells. - ``~/.cshrc`` - add the command above to your
  personal login profile to set it permanently.

----

**Why do I get** ``ifxdaq.errors.SensorNotFoundError: Found no radar device with UUID
ffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff.`` **?**

- This means there is no valid UUID stored on the internal EEPROM.
- Solution: - Download and extract the *UUID tool* (Available within the RDK). - Connect the sensor. - Open a CMD or
  Powershell. - Run the tool:

    - ``uuid_tool_strata.exe -r`` -> Read the current UUID (fff...)
    - ``uuid_tool_strata.exe -g`` -> Generate a new random UUID
    - ``uuid_tool_strata.exe -h`` -> Help

**Why do I get** ``ifxdaq.errors.SensorNotFoundError: Found no radar device with UUID
00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000.`` **?**

- This error is an indicator for a broken EEPROM.
- Since this is a hardware issue, there is no solution from our side, except the suggestion to get a new board.
- Disclaimer: In future releases, the dependency for a working EEPROM will be dropped and you will be able to use this
  board again.
